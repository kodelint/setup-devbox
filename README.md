## üöÄ Accelerate Your Development Environment Setup

`setup-devbox` is a powerful, opinionated, and highly configurable command-line tool designed to streamline the provisioning of your development environment. Say goodbye to manual installations and inconsistent setups across your machines!

By defining your desired tools, system settings, shell configurations, and fonts in simple YAML files, `setup-devbox` automates the entire process, ensuring a reproducible and consistent development workstation every time.

---

## ‚ú® Features

`setup-devbox` acts as your personal environment orchestrator, offering:

* **Declarative Configuration**: Define your entire development environment in easy-to-read YAML files.
* **Intelligent State Management**: Tracks installed tools and applied settings in a `state.json` file to prevent redundant operations and ensure efficiency.
* **Platform Support**: Currently designed for and tested on **macOS**. Linux support is planned for future releases.
* **Smart Update Policies**: Control when tools with version "latest" should be updated using the `update_latest_only_after` configuration. 
Override update policies with the `--update-latest` flag to force updates of all "latest" version tools.
* **Extensible Installer Support**:
  * üì¶ **Homebrew (`brew`)**: Install packages and applications (primarily macOS).
  * üêô **GitHub Releases (`github`)**: Download and install pre-compiled binaries.
  * ‚öôÔ∏è **Go (`go`)**: Install Go binaries and tools.
  * ü¶Ä **Cargo (`cargo`)**: Install Rust crates.
  * üêç **Pip (`pip`)**: Install Python packages.
  * ü¶Ä **Rustup (`rustup`)**: Manage and install Rust toolchains and components.
  * üöÄ **URL (`direct URL`)**: Manage and install tool directly from URL.
* **Highly Modular and Pluggable**: The architecture is designed for ease of extension. Adding support for new package managers or installation methods is straightforward, requiring minimal changes to the core logic and making `setup-devbox` adaptable to evolving needs.
* **System Settings Application**: Define macOS system preferences to be applied automatically.
* **Shell Configuration Management**: Manage shell aliases, environment variables, and dotfiles.
* **Font Installation**: Install and manage custom fonts for your terminal and editor.
* **Idempotent Operations**: Run the tool multiple times without side effects; it only applies changes if necessary.
* **Detailed Logging**: Provides clear feedback on installation progress and potential issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get `setup-devbox` up and running, you'll need the Rust toolchain installed. If you don't have Rust, you can install it via `rustup`:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs) | sh
```
Once Rust is installed, you can clone this repository and build `setup-devbox`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kodelint/setup-devbox.git
cd setup-devbox
cargo build --release
```
The compiled executable will be located at `./target/release/setup-devbox`. You might want to move it to a directory in your system's `PATH`, e.g.:
```bash
sudo mv ./target/release/setup-devbox /usr/local/bin/
```

## üöÄ Usage
`setup-devbox` primarily operates through a main `config.yaml` file, which points to other configuration files that define your desired environment.

#### 1. Create your configuration directory:
By default, `setup-devbox` looks for its configurations in `~/.setup-devbox/configs/`.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.setup-devbox/configs/
```
#### 2. Define your `config.yaml`:
This file tells `setup-devbox` where to find your other configuration files.
```yaml
# ~/.setup-devbox/configs/main_config.yaml
tools: "~/.setup-devbox/configs/tools.yaml"
settings: "~/.setup-devbox/configs/settings.yaml"
shellrc: "~/.setup-devbox/configs/shellrc.yaml"
fonts: "~/.setup-devbox/configs/fonts.yaml"
```
#### 3. Define your `tools.yaml` (and other config files):
This is where you specify the actual tools you want installed. See examples below.

#### 4. Run `setup-devbox`:
Execute the `now` command to provision your environment based on your configurations.
```bash
setup-devbox now
```

##### _(Note: Details commands are documented in [Commands](commands.md))_

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Examples 
### `tools.yaml`
```yaml
# ~/.setup-devbox/configs/tools.yaml
# Global update policy for tools with version "latest"
# Only update these tools if they haven't been updated within the specified duration
update_latest_only_after: "7 days"  # Options: "1 day", "3 days", "14 days", "24 hours", etc.

### Update Policy Behavior
The `update_latest_only_after` feature provides intelligent control over when tools with version "**latest**" should be updated:

- **Specific Versions:** Tools with explicit versions (e.g., v2.50.0, 24.4.2) are always updated when the version changes 
- **Latest Versions:** Tools with version: latest are only updated if:
    - They've never been installed before, OR 
    - Their last update was more than the specified duration ago
- **No Version Specified:** Tools without a version field are treated as "latest" and follow the update policy

#### Supported Duration Formats:

- "1 day" or "1 days"
- "7 days"
- "24 hours"
- "60 minutes"

_(**Note:** Override update policies with the `--update-latest` flag to force updates of all "latest" version tools.)_
